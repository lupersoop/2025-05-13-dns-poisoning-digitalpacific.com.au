# Digital Pacific Mirror HTTPS Redirect Analysis

*Analysis Date: Tue May 13 11:49:40 AM AEST 2025*

## Summary

This report analyzes the HTTP to HTTPS redirection behavior of Digital Pacific's mirror repositories.

**Total mirrors checked**: 3
**Mirrors that redirect to HTTPS**: 0 (0%)
**Mirrors that DO NOT redirect to HTTPS**: 3 (100%)

## Security Concerns

All mirrors currently remain accessible over unencrypted HTTP connections, allowing for potential man-in-the-middle attacks and content injection. This is particularly concerning in light of the recent DNS poisoning attack targeting these mirrors.

## Detailed Results

| Mirror URL | HTTP Status | Redirects to HTTPS | Redirect URL |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| http://fedora.mirror.digitalpacific.com.au/fedora/ | 200 | No |  |
| http://ubuntu.mirror.digitalpacific.com.au/ubuntu/ | 200 | No |  |
| http://debian.mirror.digitalpacific.com.au/debian/ | 200 | No |  |

## Security Implications

The absence of HTTPS redirects for these mirrors presents several security risks:

1. **Content Integrity**: Without HTTPS, users cannot verify the authenticity of downloaded packages, which may lead to malicious package installation.

2. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Attackers can intercept and modify traffic between users and the mirrors, potentially injecting malicious content.

3. **DNS Poisoning Amplification**: Combined with the ongoing DNS poisoning attack, the lack of HTTPS makes it easier for attackers to serve fraudulent content without triggering browser security warnings.

4. **No Certificate Validation**: Users have no way to verify they're connecting to the legitimate mirror server rather than an impersonator.

## Recommendations

1. **Implement HTTPS Redirects**: Configure all mirrors to automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.

2. **Enforce HTTPS Only**: Consider disabling HTTP access entirely after a transition period.

3. **Update Mirror Links**: Modify all web pages and documentation to reference HTTPS URLs instead of HTTP.

4. **Add Security Headers**: Implement appropriate security headers such as Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), Content-Security-Policy, and X-Content-Type-Options.

5. **Public Documentation**: Create clear documentation about the security measures in place and how users can verify the authenticity of downloads.
