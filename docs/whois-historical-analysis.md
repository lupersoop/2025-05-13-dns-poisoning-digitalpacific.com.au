### Timeline of Events

1. **Prior to May 6, 2025**: Domain using legitimate nameservers
2. **May 6, 2025**: Nameservers changed to malicious ns1.has.email, ns2.has.email
3. **May 7, 2025**: Nameservers reverted back to legitimate servers
4. **May 11-12, 2025**: DNS poisoning effects observed and documented
5. **May 13, 2025**: Initial investigation completed and repository published
6. **May 14, 2025**: Superloop suggests registrar-level modifications; confirmed via WHOIS data

## Definitive Evidence of Unauthorized Nameserver Changes

The historical WHOIS data provides conclusive evidence of unauthorized changes to domain registration records:

1. **Explicit Nameserver Change**: On May 6, 2025, the nameservers for digitalpacific.com.au were explicitly changed to the malicious ns1.has.email and ns2.has.email at the registrar level.

2. **Rapid Reversion**: The next day (May 7, 2025), the nameservers were changed back to the legitimate servers, indicating either:
   - Detection and correction by the domain owner or registrar, or
   - A deliberate short-term attack intended to minimize detection

3. **Persistence of DNS Poisoning**: Despite the nameserver reversion on May 7, the effects of the poisoning continued to be observed through May 11-12, likely due to:
   - DNS caching at various levels (resolver, ISP, OS, browser)
   - Persistence of the attacker's infrastructure

4. **Registrar Record Modification**: These changes could only have been made through or via the domain registrar's systems, confirming the attack occurred at the domain registration level as proposed by Superloop.

## Attack Mechanism Analysis

Based on the historical WHOIS data, we can reconstruct the likely attack sequence:

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Attackers gained unauthorized access to change the domain registration records. This could have happened through:
   - Domain management account compromise
   - Social engineering of registrar staff
   - Exploitation of a vulnerability in registrar systems
   - Insider action
   
   (Note: Without internal investigation data from the registrar, we cannot definitively determine which specific vector was used)

2. **Nameserver Hijacking**: The attackers changed the authoritative nameservers to their own malicious name servers (ns1.has.email, ns2.has.email).

3. **Brief Attack Window**: The nameservers were only changed for approximately 24 hours, but this was sufficient to poison DNS caches across the internet.

4. **Recovery/Reversion**: On May 7, either the domain owner or the registrar discovered and reverted the unauthorized nameserver change.

5. **Lingering Effects**: Due to DNS caching and the hierarchical nature of DNS resolution, the effects of the poisoning persisted for several days after the nameservers were corrected.

## Relationship to Our Observations

This historical WHOIS data perfectly explains our observed phenomena:

1. **Selective DNS Resolution Issues**: Different DNS resolvers have different cache periods and policies, explaining why some users (particularly Superloop customers) continued to experience the poisoning while others did not.

2. **Persistent Incorrect Records**: Once a DNS resolver cached the malicious nameserver delegation, it would continue using those servers until the cache expired, regardless of the reversion at the registrar level.

3. **Inconsistent Behavior**: The inconsistent behavior we observed across different DNS servers and networks is exactly what would be expected following a brief unauthorized change of nameserver records that was subsequently corrected.

## Impact Assessment

The historical WHOIS data reveals that this was a sophisticated attack:

1. **Targeted Domain Registration Records**: The attackers specifically targeted the domain's nameserver records.

2. **Minimal Detection Window**: By only keeping the malicious nameservers in place for ~24 hours, the attackers reduced the chance of immediate detection while still achieving widespread DNS cache poisoning.

3. **Strategic Timing**: The attack was executed and then quickly reverted, making it harder to diagnose and attribute.

4. **Extensive Impact**: Despite the brief period of actual record modification, the effects propagated widely through DNS caching mechanisms.

## Conclusion

The historical WHOIS data from WhoisFreaks.com provides definitive evidence supporting Superloop's assertion that this incident stemmed from unauthorized modification of domain registration records rather than an issue with Superloop's DNS resolvers.

The unauthorized change of nameservers to ns1.has.email and ns2.has.email on May 6, 2025, followed by reversion on May 7, 2025, created a brief but highly effective attack window that resulted in widespread DNS poisoning effects that persisted for days afterward.

This confirms that Superloop's DNS resolvers were correctly reflecting the data they received based on the temporarily modified nameserver records, rather than being compromised themselves. The attack occurred at the domain registration level, though the specific method used to make these unauthorized changes (account compromise, social engineering, system vulnerability, or insider action) cannot be determined without further investigation by the registrar.
