  - Difficulty resolving complex technical issues
- Connection and setup delays for new customers
- Technical support quality varies significantly

### Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) Complaints

While specific TIO complaint numbers for Superloop aren't publicly available, customer reviews suggest a typical pattern for mid-sized Australian ISPs:

- Some escalations to TIO for unresolved complaints
- No evidence of unusually high TIO complaint rates compared to industry peers

## Corporate Values and Trustworthiness Claims

Superloop markets itself as:

- "More tech than telco" - emphasizing technical expertise
- Australian-owned and operated

- Executive team includes dedicated security and technology leadership

## Conclusion

Superloop has grown rapidly through acquisitions to become a significant player in the Australian telecommunications market with over 350,000 customers. The company operates its own network infrastructure and positions itself as a security-conscious provider.

While customer reviews are generally positive regarding network performance and speeds, there are mixed reviews about customer service quality. Prior to the current DNS poisoning incident affecting Digital Pacific mirrors, there were no publicly documented significant security breaches or DNS-specific issues directly attributable to Superloop's infrastructure.

The current DNS poisoning issue represents a potentially significant security incident affecting Superloop's DNS infrastructure, contrasting with their previous security record and market positioning as a security-conscious provider.
